description: About Reactive Foundation
---
Reactive Foundation is committed to improving the developer experience of designing and building cloud native applications using Reactive architecture, Reactive programming, Reactive systems, streaming, Reactive Streams, event-sourcing, streaming machine learning, serverless, and other emerging technologies.

Our goal is to serve as a vendor-neutral home for the relevant projects and initiatives that developers require for cloud native application development and provide critical education around the new architectural principles necessary to take full advantage of the cloud. It's here that Reactive architecture leads the way.

## Reactive Architecture
Reactive is a proven approach to thinking, designing, building, and reasoning about software systemsâ€”in particular, distributed, highly concurrent, and data-intensive applications. Use cases include:

 - Real-time analytics
 - Internet of Things
 - Real-time decisions
 - Modern eCommerce

It's the right design and architecture for cloud native applications providing the foundation for runtime behavior excellence, resource efficiency, and meeting business service level agreements for uptime, latency, scale, and throughput as described in the Reactive Manifesto.

## Reactive Manifesto
Published in 2013 and now translated into 15 languages with endorsements by more than 28,000 technologists, the [Reactive Manifesto](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) set out key tenets for building systems that react to modern demands on application architecture at scale. The tenets of the Manifesto were not new. They originated in work by Jim Gray and Pat Helland on the Tandem System and Joe Armstrong and Robert Virding on Erlang. Only in the past decade have developers been forced to re-think best practices for application architecture in a world of mobile, multicore, cloud computing.
