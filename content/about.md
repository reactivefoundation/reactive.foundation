description: About Reactive Foundation
---
Reactive Foundation is committed to improve the developer experience of designing and building applications and systems based on Reactive Principles, patterns, and projects. 

Our goal is to serve as a vendor-neutral home for the Reactive projects and initiatives that developers require for distributed system development and provide critical education around the new principles necessary to take full advantage of the cloud. It's here that Reactive leads the way.

## Reactive Approach
Reactive is a proven approach to thinking, designing, building, and reasoning about software systemsâ€”in particular, distributed, highly concurrent, and data-intensive applications. Use cases include:
 - Real-time analytics
 - Internet of Things
 - Real-time decisions
 - Modern eCommerce
 - Real-time personalization
 - Real-time fraud detection

This approach provides the foundation for runtime behavior excellence, resource efficiency, and meeting business service level agreements for uptime, latency, scale, and throughput as described in the Reactive Manifesto.


## Reactive Manifesto
Published in 2013 and now translated into 15 languages with endorsements by more than 28,000 technologists, the [Reactive Manifesto](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) set out key tenets for building systems that react to modern demands on application architecture at scale. The tenets of the Manifesto were not new. They originated in work by Jim Gray and Pat Helland on the Tandem System and Joe Armstrong and Robert Virding on Erlang. Only in the past decade have developers been forced to re-think best practices for application architecture in a world of mobile, multicore, cloud computing.
